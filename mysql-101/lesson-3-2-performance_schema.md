## setup_instruments

Instrumenting is costly. You can be picky:

        SELECT  * FROM setup_instruments;
        ...

Or `USE sys` and just check overviews.

Use `information_schema` to find instruments & co:

        SELECT table_name,column_name FROM information_schema.columns
            WHERE column_name LIKE '%lock%'
                AND table_schema LIKE 'perf%';
