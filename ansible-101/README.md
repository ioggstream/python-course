# Ansible 2 done right!


## Local Setup

This course is based on Docker and Docker compose. As long as you have Docker
you can run it on:

- linux
- mac
- windows

Docker should be exposed via TCP on 172.17.0.1:2375

On Linux, set

```bash
$ vim /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/docker.service
[Service]
...
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// -H tcp://172.17.0.1:2375
...
```

On Mac, check [the FAQ and this issue](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/770#issuecomment-252560286)

Consider having enough bandwidth for the first run to download the images.

Run the environemnt with:

```bash
make course
```

if you want override default value of EXTERNAL_COURSES, please use an environment variable

```bash                                                                       
EXTERNAL_COURSES=git-101 make course
```

or run docker-compose manually

```bash
docker-compose scale course=1 bastion=1 web=3
firefox http://localhost:8888
```

## Playing the course on DigitalOcean

DigitalOcean is a great and cheap cloud-provider

- create an Ubuntu 16.04 docker droplet from the menu and ssh into your host
- expose docker on local http port

```bash
# vim /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/docker.service
[Service]
...
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// -H tcp://172.17.0.1:2375
...
```

- clone and run the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ioggstream/python-course.git
cd python-course/ansible-101
make course
```
