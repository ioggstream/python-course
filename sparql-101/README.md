## Elevator Pitch

Still stuck while modeling your data? Start managing your knowledge instead!
This workshop introduces tools and techniques to get the best of your information,
including graph databases, RDF, SparQL and vector embeddings.

## Abstract

This workshop introduces knowledge management tools and techniques,
showing how to describe knowledge instead of just modeling data.

Each section is based on jupyter. Participants should set up a dockerized
environment before the tutorial.

## Agenda

### Part 1

What is semantics? Describing information in a meaningful way: RDF and JSON-LD
Knowledge Graphs and related technologies
Exercises: using and querying the EU Country vocabulary

### Part 2

Storing data vs describing knowledge.
Exercises: the DevSecOps dataset as a Knowledge Graph
Getting security insights using SparQL

### Part 3

Graphs and semantic search: mixing Graph and Vector databases
Exercises: the EU Recruitment dataset (ESCO) and CV analysis
You will learn about
Resource Description Framework (RDF) and JSON-LD, rdflib
Graph databases, Openlink Virtuoso, SparQL
Vector search, Qdrant

### Prerequisites

beginner: docker, jupyter
intermediate: python, JSON, YAML, HTML, HTTP
