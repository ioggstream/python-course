# Interoperable REST API


## Local Setup

This course is based on Docker and Docker compose. As long as you have Docker
you can run it on any operating system.

Docker should be exposed via TCP on 172.17.0.1:2375. If you have concerns
in exposing docker, just use a temporary VM for the course (see below).

On Linux, set

```
# vim /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/docker.service
[Service]
...
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// -H tcp://172.17.0.1:2375
...
```

On Mac, check [the FAQ and this issue](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/770#issuecomment-252560286)


Consider having enough bandwidth for the first run to download the images.


Run the environemnt with:

    # make course

And point the browser on the printed URL, eg.

    # firefox http://localhost:8888


## Playing the course on DigitalOcean and Ansible

Once you have a digitalocean account, just
set your ssh key info in `site-digitalocean.yml`
then run the playbook:

```
$ export DO_API_TOKEN=xxxx
$ ansible-playbook -v site-digitalocean.yml
```

This will create one (or more) vms with
the course installed.

Get the jupyter notebook url at the end of the deployment.

## Playing the course on DigitalOcean

If you don't use ansible, you can always setup everything
by hand.

  - create an Ubuntu 18.04 docker droplet from the menu and ssh into your host
  - expose docker on local http port

```
# vim /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/docker.service
[Service]
...
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// -H tcp://172.17.0.1:2375
...
```

  - clone and run the project

```
 # git clone https://github.com/ioggstream/python-course.git
 # cd python-course/ansible-101
 # make course


```

 - point to the reference url
