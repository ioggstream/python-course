    "\n",
    "The historical API approach was to view any interaction like a function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a network environment this is seen as a `Remote Procedure Call`. SOAP web services have this approach,\n",
    "where you bind:\n",
    "\n",
    " * a service to an URL \n",
    " * and different functions to invocation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even today there are a lot of non-SOAP APIs using an RPC approach, including Slack APIs and Google RPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The widespread of HTTP as a distributed computation protocol, and the rise of data give birth to REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST, aka REpresentation State Transfer, is not a protocol, but an architectural style which mimics the distributed characteristics of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "In REST, everything is a `resource`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- identified by an Uniform Resource Locator URL;\n",
    "- which is conveyed by a `representation`. A given resource could be represented as `application/json` or as [`application/xml`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7303), in different languages (see `Content-Language`) and differently encoded (see `Content-Encoding`);\n",
    "- whom state is transferred between an Origin Server and a User Agent (see RFC7230);\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no \"functions\" but everything is modeled as a resource. Moreover all the HTTP semantics (RFC7231) applies, including idempotent and non-idempotent methods and caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "The REST architectural style allows us to **leverage the distributed nature of the web** and the features of HTTP which are redesigned with REST in mind (see RFC723x and the new http-core Internet-Drafts).\n",
    "\n",
    "While REST is not a silver bullet, we **acknowledged that public services are usually about data and resources** making a REST style a good approach in service modeling. \n",

    "\n",
    "**For REST APIs the standard IDL is OpenAPI v3 aka OAS3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a web service accepting the following request `GET /echo` and returning a json object could be described in OAS3 like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "  /echo:\n",

    "## Contract first, Code first\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two paths for API writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- code first: where one develops a function on a specific language and then uses some tool to generate the\n",
    "  IDL. An example function generating the above IDL could be\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  def echo():\n",
    "      item = {\"hello\": \"world\"}\n",
    "      status_code = 200\n",
    "      headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'}\n",
    "      \n",
    "      return item, status_code, headers\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "- contract first: one writes down the interface in an IDL, then let the tools generate the code stubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contract first improves standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "While lazy developers prefers to use code-first, as they could focus on writing the actual code and leave the interface as an underproduct, this approach rarely works in a large ecosystem where\n",
    "\n",
    "  * different actors \n",
    "  * in a long timeframe \n",
    "  * works with different frameworks and enviroments.\n",

    "A contract-first approach has many advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- allows to focus on the actual design of the API, without being entangled by implementation details;\n",
    "- it's independent from which framework or language people uses for its client/server implementation and from how frameworks generate the specs (which may be buggy);\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on the specs allows to create *API modeling iterations* that enable\n",
